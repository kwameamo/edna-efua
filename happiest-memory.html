			<br>
			<p>
				A trip around the beach, the sun, the sky, and around you. <br>
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				A palpable excitement as we packed up and hit the road.<br>
				We didn’t realize we were making memories; we just knew we were having fun.<br>
				The screams as the salty breeze and crashing waves greeted us upon arrival elevated our spirits.<br>
				I just knew that was enough experience and memory to last a lifetime.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				I found myself at the shoreline with the purity of the sand stretching eternally before me.<br>
				You held my hand and sped off with me along the shore, and I couldn’t hold back the giggles as the sand staggered our movements.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Guess what I put in a frame sitting on the wall directly opposite my bed?<br>
				“Jia Li.”<br>
				You never ceased to remind me how beautiful and good I was and wanted to put it in a slogan that could stick forever, and truly, it has stuck on a wall now.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Playing in the sand, building sandcastles, each time more artistic than the last.<br>
				Tussling to see who could put up the tallest tower, ploughing moats, and embellishing our castles with seashells and seaweed.</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				These moments seemed small, but looking back today, they are treasures buried in the deepest ore of my heart.</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				We spent hours splashing around the soothing ocean, playing tag and frisbee.<br>
				I still have a vivid picture of the guffawing moments as we jumped over waves and the occasional tumble into the surf.<br>
				Feeling ostensibly carefree, with the warmth of the sun on my skin and your chortling laughter echoing.</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Coincidentally, this day felt like a summer day in Svalbard with the sun never setting above the Arctic Circle, even as the day seemed to wind down.</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				As the sun began to set, painting the sky in shades of pink and orange, we gathered wood, set up a bonfire, roasted marshmallows, and made s’mores, the gooey sweetness finely complementing the warmth of the fire.</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				This day reminds me of what Banana Yoshimoto said: “Truly, happy memories always live on, shining. Over time, one by one, they come back to life.”</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				We spotted a leisure bench, I sat on your lap, shared stories, and reminisced about past vacations, which created a nostalgic atmosphere that made the moment even more unforgettable.</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Worn out as we were, we could only eat and drink to the pleasure of our souls.<br>
				In the midst of tiredness and endless fulfillment, we decided to settle and relax.<br>
				I laid my head on your chest and could only smell your sweet musky fragrance.<br>
				I smelled you for hours and couldn’t let go.</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				After hours of seemingly eternal thrill, we decided to go home.<br>
				You dropped me off at home and drove off.<br>
				Never heard from you again, only to find out you never got home!</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				I can only smile because it happened, not cry because it’s over.<br>
				This frame rekindles the memories of a lifetime that unfolded, and I can only be grateful for the happy memories.</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Thank you for the happiest memory of my life.</p>
